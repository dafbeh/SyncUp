Lightsail settings:
pm2 start server.js
pm2 list
pm2 stop 0

What succeeded:
    - Check Git Pushes

What Failed:
    - Added a refresh button so a new user could join and press the refresh button to sync,
        I did this by keeping a timer that updated on every action, (seeking, pause, play, start).
        This however didn't work as if an action was done 30 seconds ago then it would sync them to 30 seconds back.
